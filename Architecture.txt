All game logic and rules will be moved into backend for the server to handle.

The NEW Architecture will be based on Server-source-of-truth.
Example of the game flow:

0) Player attemps to move a piece from (x, y) to (xT, yT)
1) The web (client) sends 'move-attempt' along with data to Server (and only this, no movement yet)
    - The web has a listener for the server response to confirm move is valid.
2) The server receives 'move-attempt' and data, and forwards data to game rule checker.
    ok) Valid -> send back to ALL clients (io.emit) 'move-accepted'
    nope) Invalid -> send back to ALL clients (io.emit) 'move-rejected'

ok) If move is accepted, the web (client) will update:
- GUI: Pieces on board (placement and removal)
- DOM: All attributes on DOMs such as button-value

nope) If move is rejected, the web (client) will respond with rejection-feedback:
- GUI: no updates -> invalid move feedback (red color) + soundfx?
- DOM: no updates
